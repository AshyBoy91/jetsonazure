```bash
# Show the application running
python main.py

# Show direct IoT Hub connection
# Point out real-time telemetry in Azure Portal
```

### **Step 2: Demonstrate Edge Processing**

**Script:** "Now I'll show you the enhanced version with edge processing. Notice how we're doing local analytics and intelligent filtering."

**Commands to run:**
```bash
# Run IoT Edge version
python iot_edge_main.py

# Show local processing in action
# Demonstrate real-time analytics
```

### **Step 3: Remote Management Demo**

**Script:** "Watch how we can manage this device remotely from Azure Portal."

**Actions:**
1. Open Azure IoT Hub in browser
2. Navigate to IoT Edge devices
3. Show device twin configuration
4. Call direct method `get_edge_analytics`
5. Update device twin properties live

### **Step 4: Alert System Demo**

**Script:** "Let me simulate a high CPU condition to show our intelligent alerting."

**Commands:**
```bash
# Simulate high CPU load
stress --cpu 4 --timeout 60s

# Show alerts being generated locally
# Show alerts in Azure Portal
```

### **Step 5: Local vs Cloud Processing**

**Script:** "Here's the key advantage - watch the difference between local and cloud processing."

**Comparison:**
- **Local Processing**: < 100ms response time
- **Cloud Processing**: 500-2000ms response time
- **Bandwidth Usage**: 90% reduction with edge filtering

### **Step 6: Update Management**

**Script:** "Finally, let me show automated updates from our development pipeline."

**Actions:**
